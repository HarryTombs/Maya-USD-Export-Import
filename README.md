Excuse the MS paint

This is the only idea i've had and im not sure if its even a good one

its like a combo of the group node in houdini and "conditional formating" in excel

Basically once an object meets a criteria set by the user (Something like the menu in the drawing) it can be added to a group, renamed, recoloured or selected etc

This is how the conditional formating works, i've set rules that when green is typed in a square it turns green etc etc

So something similar with my script in Maya would be: selecting only objects that are outside of a sphere radius of 5cm and have more than 100 polys, the script would take those parameters search through the file and select or organise them based on the users preference of layout after finding those objects

it could be selecting only lights that are really far away or finding really high desnity models hidden somewhere, Obviously an organised Maya user may not need this but if it was used in a way that auto updates like in excel it could speed up workflows of teadious organising.

I'm not sure, This might be too easy or too hard but i like it enough to try!!
